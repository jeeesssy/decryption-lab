# Decryption Lab (SAST & Dependabot practice)

This lab shows how to:
- Enable Dependabot for dependency alerts.
- Add CodeQL for SAST scanning via GitHub Actions.
- Find and fix a simple SAST vulnerability.

## Tasks
1. Inspect the `run.py` file and run CodeQL action (Actions tab).
2. Check **Security â†’ Code scanning alerts** for SAST findings.
3. Fix the vulnerable code (remove/secure subprocess usage), commit, and verify the alert is resolved.
4. Optionally add `.github/dependabot.yml` to enable Dependabot alerts.
